<br>
<br>eCoinSupply makes buying and selling bitcoins easy. There are two main options to buy bitcoins on Cryptopay: account purchase and with a bank card. The former is described below and the latter in this article.
<br>
<br>In order to buy bitcoins in our service, you need to make sure that you have enough funds in one of your eCoinSupply accounts. So the first step is depositing funds into your eCoinSupply account.
<br>
<br>Once you have done that, you will be able to buy bitcoins in your account. Simply Log in and head to the “Accounts” tab of your eCoinSupply account. There you’ll see our simple and elegant currency exchange tool next to all of your accounts.
<br>
<br>Use it to choose which currency to buy bitcoins (or any other supported cryptocurrency ) with, and then, provided you have sufficient funds, you will be able to buy bitcoins.
<br>
<br>Once you’ve chosen the account you wish to use, enter the number of bitcoins you want to buy or the amount you want to spend to buy bitcoins. Please note: For such transactions, we charge a 1% conversion fee.
<br>
<br>You can press the number next to the word “Maximum”  to automatically calculate how many bitcoins you can buy with the funds in your chosen account (fees included).<br><br>Once everything is filled in, press "Exchange". You'll see the information one more time to make sure everything is correct. Press "Confirm" to proceed.
<br>
<br>All done!
<br>
<br>If you have any further questions about the process, feel free to contact our support team.<br></p>

<br>
<br>Simply Log in, click on "Exchange", and you’ll see our simple currency exchange tool.
<br>
<br>To sell bitcoins you need to transfer funds from your Bitcoin account to your Euro, US Dollar, or British Pounds account. 
<br>
<br>Please note:  For such transactions we charge a 1% conversion fee.
<br>
<br>When you’ve chosen the wallet you want to transfer your bitcoins to, enter the amount of funds you wish to sell.  You can also press the maximum number to transfer all the bitcoins in your account to the chosen eCoinSupply account.
<br>
<br>Once you have inserted the sum, press "Exchange". In the next pop-up window, you will be given the exchange rate, the fee and how much in total you will get. Please double-check everything and press "Confirm".<br><br>Alternatively, you can simply withdraw the funds in Bitcoin to your bank account within a SEPA zone.<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">The first thing you need to know when sending funds to an external Ripple wallet is the XRP address of the receiver and a destination tag, if there is one.
<br>
<br>Destination tag is a figure (with a maximum of 10 digits), unique to each wallet. A destination tag works just like a reference number with bank transactions.
<br>
<br>A destination tag identifies the transaction when multiple transactions from different senders are sent to the same receiving address used by multiple users. With exchanges and hosted wallets, the destination tag identifies the user within the receiving exchange or wallet. 
<br>
<br>It's important to know, that some services provide unique Ripple addresses for each user and don't require the destination tag.
<br>
<br>Once you know the address and a destination tag, press "Withdraw" near your Ripple account.
<br>
<br>Then select "External crypto wallet" and in the pop-up window insert the XRP address, the amount and the destination tag. 
<br>
<br>Please note: the minimum amount to send is 0.001 XRP. To fund a new XRP address, you must send enough XRP to meet the reserve requirement. The current minimum reserve requirement is 20 XRP. Transactions of less than 20 XRP sent to a newly created XRP address will fail. 
<br>
<br>Important: XRP transactions without a destination tag will not be executed.
<br>
<br>If you’re sure that there’s no destination tag required, you can put “0” in the destination tag field.<br><br>Important: If you put “0" as a Destination tag for a wallet used by multiple users, your funds will be lost PERMANENTLY.&nbsp;</p>

                                   Depositing LTC</strong><br><br>You can use address for depositing funds to your eCoinSupply account. However, if you come across the situation when you cannot deposit to eCoinSupply from an external wallet because the address is not accepted or marked invalid, no worries! This means your external wallet does not support new LTC address formats yet. 
<br>
<br>We have a solution for you :) You can easily convert your eCoinSupply address to an old format and use it to make a deposit. In order to convert the format, just press the QR code icon near your Litecoin account and then press convert to old format.<br><br>You can now use the old format address to make a deposit. Funds will be received in your LTC wallet no matter which format you used. 
<br>
<br><strong>Sending LTC<br></strong>
<br>You might also need to convert the address when sending LTC to an external wallet. If someone gives you an old format address and the system does not accept it, just press convert to new format.<br><br>That way you'll get a new format address that you can use to send funds.<br>
<br>Please note: both new and old formats indicate the same address.<strong><br></strong></p>

<br>
<br>There are three types of deposits available to eCoinSupply users:
<br>
<br>    Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether and XRP deposits
<br>    SEPA Bank deposits
<br>    Card deposits
<br>
<br>NB: Bank and Card deposits are available for verified users only, while Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether and XRP deposits are available for everyone.
<br>
<br>For example, to make a Bitcoin deposit, press the QR-Code icon near your BTC account.
<br>
<br>After pressing the icon, you will be given the Bitcoin address.<br><br>To make a deposit, scan the QR-code or copy the Bitcoin address to your clipboard and use it as a destination for your transaction.
<br>
<br>NB: We process BTC transactions after 3 confirmations on the network.
<br>
<br>The process of depositing Litecoin and XRP is the same as above.
<br>
<br>The minimum BTC/LTC/ETH deposit is 0.00000001 BTC/LTC/ETH.
<br>
<br>The minimum XRP deposit is 0.000001 XRP.
<br>
<br>Important: the Destination Tag is an extra piece of information that must be included when sending a Ripple transaction. To find your destination tag click on your XRP wallet address in your eCoinSupply account.  Your destination tag is a combination of numbers right after the symbols  dt=.  
<br>
<br>The destination tag identifies your transaction from different senders.  Always ensure to include the correct Destination Tag before sending your XRP deposit. 
<br>
<br>If you put destination tag incorrectly or leave out this information, funds will not be credited to your XRP wallet, and therefore, will be lost. 
<br>
<br>Please note: our system doesn't process sums with more than 8 decimal digits.
<br>
<br>To make a Bank deposit, press "Bank deposit" near EUR account.<br><br>Once you click on "Show deposit details", you will be given the necessary requisites. Use these details to make a transfer from your SEPA bank account at any branch of your bank or online.
<br>
<br>If you've chosen Card deposit, just press the corresponding button near the coin you would like to buy.<br><br>In the opened pop-up enter the amount of funds you wish to spend. Remember to stay within limits.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, you can find and use the Buy button on your Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple Account page.<br><br>Now that you've successfully deposited funds into your eCoinSupply account, after some processing time, they will be fully available for use.<br></p>

<br>In order to purchase bitcoins with your card, you need to make sure that you are verified in eCoinSupply and have an active credit/debit card* issued in your name with the 3D Secure option enabled and sufficient funds to make this transaction.
<br>
<br>*We can accept VISA, VISA Delta, MasterCard, MasterCard Debit, International Maestro, UK Maestro, and VISA Electron.
<br>
<br>How do I go about buying bitcoins with a debit/credit card?
<br>
<br>1. Go to the “Accounts” page and click the "Buy bitcoins" button next to your Bitcoin Account.<br><br>    Alternatively, you can use the "Buy bitcoins" button on your Bitcoin Account page.<br>
<br>2. In the opened pop-up, in the "Amount" field enter the amount of funds you wish to purchase BTC with. Payments are processed in EUR, USD, and GBP. 
<br>
<br>In order to avoid unnecessary conversion fees in the process, you can choose which of the supported currencies (EUR/USD/GBP) is more suitable for you. Funds will be converted automatically using the applicable rate of your bank.
<br>
<br>Please note: we can accept VISA, VISA Delta, MasterCard, MasterCard Debit, International Maestro, UK Maestro, and VISA Electron.
<br>
<br>Remember to stay within limits.
<br>
<br>To the right you'll see the amount of bitcoins you are going to get. The exchange rate and the processing fee will be displayed at the bottom.
<br>
<br>Once you are ready, click the "Proceed" button.
<br>
<br>3. On the next screen enter your card details.
<br>
<br>If you already have a linked card, you will see its details in this pop-up. 
<br>
<br>Once you are ready, click the "Pay now" button. 
<br>
<br>Please note: we don't keep your card details. They are tokenised in the encrypted form so that we can process your further transactions with this card.
<br>
<br>4. After pressing the "Pay now" button, you will be redirected to your bank's 3D Secure page. Enter the 3D Secure code, and you'll be redirected back to eCoinSupply.
<br>
<br>5. Once the transaction is successfully processed, you will see a pop-up with results and transaction details.
<br>
<br>Funds will be automatically credited to your eCoinSupply Bitcoin wallet, and you will be able to see this transaction in the history of your BTC account.

<br>For security and fraud prevention reasons, the amount you can spend to buy BTC, LTC, ETH and XRP with your card is limited. These limits vary based on the purchase history of your account and different security factors.
<br>
<br>Here are the limits every eCoinSupply user will have once they decide to purchase cryptocurrencies with a bank card.
<br>
<br>Minimum single deposit: 10 EUR/USD/GBP
<br>
<br>Maximum daily deposit: 1000 EUR/USD/GBP
<br>
<br>Maximum monthly deposit: 5000 EUR/USD/GBP
<br>
<br>Once you have reached your maximum monthly deposit limit, we will review your purchase history and increase the limits of your account*.
<br>
<br>For many of you, this would not be enough. Want to deposit 15 000 a day and 50 000 a month? We understand that, hence we encourage you to use this feature actively. This is the best way you can boost your limits to the moon!
<br>
<br>Please note: eCoinSupply support team has no power to recalculate or increase your card deposit limits. It is made automatically.
<br>___________________________
<br>
<br>*To make a positive decision, we pay attention to the following:
<br>
<br>– if you deposit using your existing limits/volumes to the fullest;
<br>
<br>– if you make deposits regularly;

<br>
<br>What is 3D Secure?
<br>
<br>3D Secure is a protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online credit and debit card transactions. It was originally developed with the intention of improving the security of Internet payments.
<br>
<br>Basically, 3D Secure adds an authentication step for online payments. "3D" stands for 3 Domain: there are 3 parties that are involved in the 3D Secure process:
<br>
<br>- Issuer (the bank that issued the card);
<br>- Acquirer (the bank and the merchant to whom the money is being paid);
<br>- Interoperability (the infrastructure provided by the card scheme, credit, debit, prepaid, or other types of payment cards to support the 3D Secure protocol). 
<br>
<br>What cards can be accepted through 3D Secure?
<br>
<br>As 3D Secure is controlled by VISA and MasterCard, the following cards can be used: VISA, VISA Delta, MasterCard, MasterCard Debit, International Maestro, UK Maestro, and VISA Electron.
<br>
<br>How can I learn if my card is already registered in the “3D Secure” service?
<br>
<br>You can ask the issuer of your card whether it supports 3D Secure or not.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, you will know if your card supports the “3D Secure” service whenever you are making a purchase and get asked to enter your 3D Secure password.&nbsp;<br></p>
