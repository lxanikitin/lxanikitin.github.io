                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">eCoinSupply verification process is divided into a few steps: depending on how you are going to use the account, we offer you 3 tiers of verification.
<br>
<br>Higher tiers mean that more options become available for you, the deposit/withdrawal limits are raised, and the protection of your account is reinforced. In order to upgrade a tier, you are asked to provide an additional document which confirms your identity. These verification requirements, also known as KYC (Know Your Customer), help us enhance the security of the service and the safety of our clients’ funds.
<br>
<br>You may choose the verification tier which fits your needs based on the limits and services you require.
<br>
<br>Tier 1 – you can use our wallet to store, exchange, send and receive BTC/LTC/XRP/ETH (digital currencies). We also offer accounts in USD, EUR and GBP which can be used to exchange currencies and thus avoid the market fluctuations. You can learn more about how eCoinSupply wallet works while reading the corresponding article in our Helpdesk.  To get to Tier 1 you need to verify your phone number.
<br>
<br>Tier 2 – you can make a SEPA deposit in EUR to your eCoinSupply account and buy BTC, LTC, XRP or ETH with your card if it supports 3D secure.
<br>
<br>Also, you can withdraw funds to your bank account. More detailed information can be found in the Helpdesk section on Deposits and withdrawals. In order to obtain Tier 2, you are required to submit a proof of ID and a selfie with your ID in your hands.
<br>
<br>Tier 3 – enjoy bank transfers and deposits with the card with much higher limits than at Tier 2. You will be required to upload a proof of address at this stage.
<br><br>*Total fiat deposits and withdrawals on the Tier 2 are limited to 15 000 EUR per annum</p>

<br>
<br>    Passport (double page)
<br>    National ID card (both sides)
<br>    Driving license (both sides)&nbsp;<br>Important: To avoid delays when verifying your account, make sure that your document is:
<br>

<br>    High-quality (colour images with resolution of at least 300 DPI and more than 100 Kb in size);
<br>    Valid (its expiry date must be clearly visible and not due in the next 6 months).<br><br>2. A proof of residency. High-quality scans of the following documents are acceptable:

<br>    Credit card statement;
<br>    Utility bills: water, electricity, etc.
<br>    Broadband home internet bill, landline phone bill, bundles, etc.
<br>    Tax return, council tax bill;
<br>    Government-issued certificate of residency.<br><br>Important: To ensure that your verification goes smooth and fast.&nbsp;<br>
<br>    take a photo of a paper document (with your mobile phone) or upload an original digital version of it in PDF; 
<br>    make sure, it has been issued in the last 3 months; 
<br>    it’s addressed to your name and home address. 
<br>
<br>Note: To avoid delays make sure the documents you provide are NOT protected by a password. If you can't remove the password (for example, the password is set by a bank) please contact our support team after uploading your document.
<br>
<br>3. A selfie with your ID document in your hands.
<br>Please, make sure that every detail of the ID document is clearly visible.<br><br>Note: Screenshots, mobile phone bills, medical bills, and insurance documents are NOT accepted for verification. For documents drafted in languages that use non-Latin characters (Arabic, Chinese, etc.), a certified translation into English is required.&nbsp;<br></p>

However, if we experience a heavy influx of new users, processing times for verification can slow down considerably. If you experience delays it doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong with your application.
<br>
<br>Please be patient, and we'll contact you if we need any further information from you. Keep an eye on the email inbox associated with your eCoinSupplyaccount to see if you've received a letter from us regarding your verification.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                   That doesn't mean that you need to hire a professional photographer to take pictures of your documents, just retake them using these tips.<br><br>Sometimes a photo or a scan has some minor flaws that make important information or images illegible.<br><br>Please, don’t use camscanner. If you don’t have an actual scanner, just take a picture with your phone.
<br>
<br>One of the two requirements is that a file should be unedited. It is natural that you would like your pictures to look neat, so you crop or brighten them in editors. Please, don't alternate your photos digitally.
<br>
<br>Your ID should be clearly seen, including all the edges, don’t worry if your document is small and a scan is an A4 format file, as long as everything is visible, it doesn’t matter.<br></p>

<br>
<br>When uploading a file for verification, sometimes you get this error: “the file is too small”. These size and resolution requirements have been adopted due to security reasons. In order to make sure that the photo of a document has been made by the owner and not simply copied or stolen, the file needs to be at least 100 kB in size.
<br>
<br>Normally, a phone camera takes pictures that range in file size from 1.5 MB to 2.5 MB. So what you would want to do is to make sure that you are not making your file smaller accidentally.
<br>
<br>1. How do I learn the properties of my photo?
<br>
<br>Mac OS: right-click on the file and choose “Get info”.
<br>
<br>Windows: its size will be shown in your Windows Explorer bar when you click on the file.
<br>
<br>Android: you can choose the size of pictures yourself in settings.
<br>
<br>iPhone: unfortunately, iPhone doesn’t give users an opportunity to find out the image size but you don’t need to worry, because all iPhone-taken photos are bigger than 100 kB.
<br>
<br>2. What if you’ve taken a picture with a 13-megapixel camera and you still see this error when uploading?
<br>
<br>This must be due to the import method you've used. If you send your picture using a messenger or via email, it automatically compresses and makes it a few times smaller.
<br>
<br>Please note: web cameras and laptop built-in cameras take pictures of the small size and poor quality, and are not advisable for taking pictures that you plan to use for verification.
<br>
<br>3. What can I do then?
<br>
<br>If you upload verification documents from your computer, import photos using the standard method that is suggested when you connect your device to a computer, i.e. Autoplay import in Windows and iPhoto in macOS. In this case you can be 100% sure that the image remains as it is: without any conversion or resizing.
<br>
<br>Alternatively, if you take photos with an iPhone, it is much easier to upload them using eCoinSupply&nbsp;application.
<br>
<br>To start verification go to “Other” -&gt; “Settings” -&gt; “Start verification”.
<br>
<br>eCoinSupply app takes and uploads pictures simultaneously, so you don’t have to worry about size and resolution.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">The major issue our clients from Japan face while trying to get verified is the documents' language - we do not accept documents with non-latin characters, so documents in Japanese cannot be accepted. 
<br>
<br>A customer has two options - the document must either be translated into English by a certified translation agency or it must be drafted in English right from the start.
<br>
<br>For the confirmation of identity we accept the Japanese passport - all details there are written in English and you don't have to translate it. Other ID documents, such as a driver's licence, must be translated into English.
<br>
<br>The easiest way to verify your address is to provide a bank statement in English. We accept some current account statements from such banks as SMBC, Resona Bank or Sumito Mitsui Banking Corporation. Those major banks do provide statements in English. All other documents must be coupled with a certified translation into English.&nbsp;</p>
