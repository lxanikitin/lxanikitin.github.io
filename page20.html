<br>
<br>eCoinSupply provides the most convenient and cost-effective option to accept bitcoin payments within Europe. Our developer tools give clients the ability to accept bitcoin payments while also protecting themselves from the price volatility attached to owning bitcoins. We also provide our clients with the options to make bitcoin payments as well as the ability to exchange bitcoins manually through our API.
<br>
<br>Our bitcoin payment processing solution is referred to as an “invoice”. An invoice is simply a request for a certain bitcoin payment. Invoices contain a unique bitcoin address and the requested amount that will be paid provided that the invoice is valid.
<br>
<br>What are the advantages of accepting bitcoin payments over traditional means of payment? 
<br>
<br>    No chargebacks, or any fraud possibility
<br>    Access to international markets
<br>    No need to comply with PCI-DSS
<br>    Low fees, no rolling reserve
<br>
<br>How it works:
<br>
<br>    Whenever a customer wants to make a payment to your business using bitcoins, we’ll receive the API request from you, and once we've received this request we create an invoice;
<br>    Your customer then makes a BTC payment to the specially created unique BTC address attached to the invoice;
<br>    After the invoice is paid, we convert the received amount to your original invoice currency. Then, we credit the converted amount to your eCoinSupply account. At the moment, eCoinSupply provides seven accounts in four different currencies: BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP, EUR, USD, and GBP.
<br>
<br>How do you go about getting set up with us?
<br>
<br>Until your account has been assigned a corporate status, you are able to gain access to our test environment, or “sandbox”. That way you will get to know our service better while you wait for your company’s documents to be verified.
<br>
<br>Please, contact eCoinSupply by sending an email. The letter must contain the following information:
<br>
<br>    Name of the company, its core business area and URL
<br>    Detailed description of the project
<br>    Link to the project site
<br>
<br>You’ll then receive an email containing an access key for the sandbox API. Also, the user will be given test funds for all five accounts: BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, EUR, USD, and GBP.</p>

<br>Normally, we'll get in touch with you within 1 business day. But there is no need to worry if, for some reason, you experience delays in response - we will surely contact you within 2-3 days tops.

<br>
<br>As soon as the account gets verified, we tag it as the "Corporate" one.

<br>
<br>We are required to ask you for your company’s documents due to KYC/AML rules brought upon us by the UK legal system.  
<br>
<br>Please check this article to find a list of documents that we have to receive from you in order to verify your corporate account.
<br>
<br>After we verify your account and tag it as the corporate one, you will be able to start using the eCoinSupply API, buy and sell bitcoins as well as perform bank transfers within the SEPA zone on behalf of your company. Please note that at the same time you will be restricted from using this account as your personal one.
<br>
<br>Please note:  we are not licensed to provide our services to residents and citizens of the USA and any of its lands.</p>

If your company operates on several websites under the same legal entity, it may be prudent for you to create separate projects within your corporate account so that you can keep track of all the different transactions and balances separately.
<br>
<br>The project under your company’s name is automatically created in our system when your eCoinSupply corporate account verification is completed:
<br>
<br>Per your request, eCoinSupply corporate accounts manager may enable an option to add projects to our system. Once it is turned on in your account, it looks like this:
<br>
<br>After clicking “Add a project”, you’ll get the following window:
<br>
<br>Fill in these fields with corresponding information (your project’s name, website and description) and click “Add a project”.
<br>
<br>This project is now available in your account.
<br>
<br>When a new project is activated, you can switch between the projects in your account and change their settings (Settings → Project settings).
<br>
<br>You can manage your projects separately and choose different settings for each of them.
<br>
<br>If you are no longer willing to use your project, you can contact our support team to get it removed from your corporate account.</p>

<br>
<br>    Go to the Settings page;
<br>    Click “Bank accounts” on the bottom of the page:
<br>
<br>3. Click “Add bank account” and put the name on the account, its currency and the account number in the correspondent fields.<br>
<br>Please note: You can link only the bank account held in your verified company’s name.
<br>

<br> Choose your linked bank account, enter the amount you want to send, and click “Withdraw”.<br><br>NB! Bank transfers take 1-2 business days to be processed.
<br>

In our case, we require your mobile phone with a special App where a single-use code is generated. Once 2FA is enabled, you will need to enter this six-digit code to the correspondent field every time you log in.
<br>
<br>This adds a second layer of defence and makes it almost impossible for anyone but you to access your corporate account.
<br>How to turn on 2FA?
<br>
<br>Please follow these steps to turn on 2FA for your eCoinSupply’s corporate account:
<br>
<br>    Log into your business account and click Security on the settings page:
<br>    In the pop-up window, on the left side, you can see QR-code, scan it with a two-factor app like Authy or Google Authenticator;
<br>    Put the validation code in the below field and press Enable 2FA.
<br>
<br>That’s it! Now your business account is protected with Two-Factor Authentication.</p>

<br>
<br>For example, you went on a vacation and had an urge to sign in in your business account (we've been there and we understand that). First of all, we will ask you to verify your IP address via e-mail. Once it’s done, log in to your account and do the things you wanted to do.
<br>
<br>But what if you don’t want anyone in your company to see this IP address? Or what if your account got compromised from a particular IP address? No worries, we got your back covered.
<br>
<br>Go to the Settings page –&gt; Security.
<br>
<br>Choose the IP address you want to delete.
<br>
<br>Voila! The deleted IP address will no longer have access to your precious eCoinSupply account.</p>
