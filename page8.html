<br>1.	Please read this document carefully, as it sets out the terms and conditions on which ECoinSupply Limited (referred to as "ECoinSupply") will provide services to you.
<br>2.	In this document, references to we/our/us are to ECoinSupply. Any references to Customer/you/your are references to you as a customer of ECoinSupply and user of either or both Websites. Any references to the "Website" includes both the ECoinSupply Website and the ECoinSupply Instant Website. 
<br>3.	This Agreement will govern the use of the Services provided through the Website operated by ECoinSupply. By using the Website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set out on this webpage (the "Agreement"). This Agreement will come into effect when you confirm electronically on the Website that you agree to it. We recommend that you retain a copy of this Agreement, Fee Tariff and transaction records. 
<br>4.	The services that are provided through the Website can only be used in a limited way as they only allow the Customer to acquire goods or services on this Website. 
<br>5.	The risk of loss in trading or holding Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency can be substantial. Cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading, holding or transferring Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold bitcoin, you should be aware that the price or value of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. 
<br>6.	Use of cryptocurrency may be illegal in some jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to know the regulatory requirements concerning transactions with cryptocurrency in your jurisdiction before using the Services. 
<br>7.	For the purposes of this Agreement a "Business Day" is any day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in the UK and which the banks are open for business in London. 
<br>2.	Services provided to you 
<br>1.	ECoinSupply provides the following services to you through the ECoinSupply Website: 
<br>1.	allowing you to purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin or any other cryptocurrency ("Cryptocurrency") that can be purchased through the ECoinSupply Website from ECoinSupply ("Cryptocurrency Purchase"); 
<br>2.	Cryptocurrency storage services, whereby Cryptocurrency (whether purchased from ECoinSupply or transferred from an external Cryptocurrency wallet) and fiat currency is stored in a multi-currency digital wallet ("Cryptocurrency Storage"); 
<br>3.	Cryptocurrency transfer services, whereby Cryptocurrency stored in your online ECoinSupply wallet may be transferred to: 
<br>(a) another customer’s ECoinSupply wallet; or 
<br>(b) a Cryptocurrency wallet, being either your wallet or another person’s wallet, maintained and operated by a third party ("Cryptocurrency Transfer”); and 
<br>4.	Cryptocurrency withdrawals, whereby Cryptocurrency may be sold to ECoinSupply in exchange for fiat currency with the proceeds being transferred to your Linked Account (as defined below) ("Cryptocurrency Withdrawal"). 
<br>2.	ECoinSupply provides the following service to you through the ECoinSupply Instant Website: 
<br>1.	allowing you to purchase any Cryptocurrency that can be purchased through the ECoinSupply Instant Website from ECoinSupply ("Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase"). 
<br>3.	Together, the services set out in clauses 2.1.1 to 2.1.4 and 2.2.1 are referred to in this Agreement as the "Services". 
<br>4.	ECoinSupply may also offer additional services to those listed above in clauses 2.1.1 to 2.1.4 and 2.2 from time to time. Such additional services shall be provided under terms and conditions separate to this Agreement. 
<br>3.	Customer registration process 
<br>1.	To be eligible to become a Customer you must: 
<br>1.	be at least 18 years old; 
<br>2.	have capacity to enter into legally binding contracts; and 
<br>3.	if you wish to use the Cryptocurrency Withdrawal services set out in clause 2.1.4, you must have an Eligible Bank Account (as defined in clause 3.2) that can be linked to the Cryptocurrency Withdrawal Services provided by ECoinSupply under this Agreement (the "Linked Account"). 
<br>2.	The types of bank accounts that qualify as eligible bank accounts are Euro deposit accounts in the Customer’s name that can make or receive payments in the Single Euro Payments Area and are held with a bank in the United Kingdom or the Single Euro Payments Area ("Eligible Bank Accounts"). ECoinSupply reserves the right to amend the types of bank accounts that qualify as Eligible Bank Accounts at any time. 
<br>3.	To become a Customer you must also provide ECoinSupply with the information that is requested as part of the account opening process. This includes the information to satisfy "know your client" and anti-money laundering checks. Failure to provide any information that ECoinSupply reasonably requests from you pursuant to applicable money laundering laws and regulations after you have become a Customer shall be grounds for the suspension of the provision of Services to you (including access to your account) under clause 12 and/or the termination of this Agreement under clause 21. The nature and extent of the information you are required to provide may differ, for example, based on the Services provided to you under this Agreement and/or the means of payment you use. 
<br>4.	Accessing your account through the ECoinSupply Website 
<br>1.	When applying to become a Customer to use the ECoinSupply Website, you will be asked to create your individual Customer account ("Account") which will include a username and password ("ccount Details"). Once registered you will be able to access your Account through the ECoinSupply Website using your Account Details in accordance with this Agreement. 
<br>2.	Each time you seek to access your Account we will check your identity by asking for your Account Details. As long as your correct Account Details are entered, we will assume that you are the person giving instructions and you will be liable for those instructions. You must therefore keep the Account Details secret and secure and make sure that they are not stored in a way that enables others to access them or impersonate you. In addition, if you disclose the Account Details to any person whom you authorise to access your Account, you are also responsible and liable for any access, use, misuse or disclosure of your Account Details and/or your Account by such person. 
<br>3.	You must notify us by e-mail at support@eCoinSupply.me immediately if you discover or suspect: 
<br>1.	the loss or disclosure to any unauthorised person of any Account Details; 
<br>2.	any unauthorised access to your Account; 
<br>3.	any other criminal or fraudulent activity relating to your Account; or 
<br>4.	any other breach of security relating to your Account, whether physical or relating to computer or similar hardware or software. 
<br>4.	If we receive such a notification from you or determine ourselves that the security of your Account Details may have been breached, you will not be able to access your Account until measures have been taken to verify your identity. 
<br>5.	Unless and until you tell us that you believe that someone else knows the Account Details or can use your Account by impersonating you: 
<br>1.	you will be responsible for any instruction which we receive and act on, even if it was not given by you; and 
<br>2.	we will not be responsible for any unauthorised access to your Account or the information available in it. 
<br>5.	Using the ECoinSupply instant website 
<br>1.	You are able to enter into a Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase without being required to open an Account. If you wish to use any of the Services offered through the ECoinSupply Website, you will need to open an Account as set out in clause 4. 
<br>6.	Cryptocurrency Purchase 
<br>1.	Once you have completed the customer registration process associated with the Services you would like to receive under this Agreement to our satisfaction and your Account has been opened, you will be able to purchase Cryptocurrencies from us through the ECoinSupply Website, subject to the applicable fees which are set out in the tariff of fees ("Fee Tariff") which can be found on the ECoinSupply Website. The price, exchange rate and amount of the Cryptocurrency that you wish to purchase will be confirmed through the Website at the time that you place an order for a Cryptocurrency Purchase. 
<br>2.	There are two methods by which you can make a Cryptocurrency Purchase: 
<br>1.	you may deposit fiat currency in to your Account by way of a bank transfer from an Eligible Bank Account and then use the “Exchange” functionality on your Account page to exchange this fiat currency for Cryptocurrency; or 
<br>2.	you may select the “buy bitcoins” option accessible through your Account page and purchase Cryptocurrency using a credit or debit card. 
<br>3.	The fees applicable to each method of Cryptocurrency Purchase are as set out in the Fee Tariff. 
<br>4.	Acceptance by us of an order for a Cryptocurrency Purchase does not guarantee that you will receive the corresponding amount of Cryptocurrency into your Wallet (as defined below). The Cryptocurrency Purchase is conditional upon actual receipt by us of the funds from an Eligible Bank Account or by way of credit or debit card, as well as payment of any applicable fees. 
<br>5.	Subject to clause 6.4 and the transaction being honoured by the Customer’s bank, card provider or other relevant party, Cryptocurrency Purchases will be credited to the Wallet as soon as possible once the Cryptocurrency Purchase has been confirmed by the Cryptocurrency network. Once submitted to a Cryptocurrency network, a Cryptocurrency Purchase will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Cryptocurrency network. Cryptocurrency transactions that are in a pending state will not be credited to the Wallet (as defined below). 
<br>7.	Cryptocurrency instant Purchase 
<br>1.	You will be able to purchase Cryptocurrencies from us through the ECoinSupply Instant Website subject to the applicable fees which are set out in the Fee Tariff which can be found on the ECoinSupply Instant Website. The price, exchange rate and amount of the Cryptocurrency that you wish to purchase will be confirmed through the Website at the time that you place an order for a Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase. 
<br>2.	You can make a Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase using the instant bitcoin purchase option accessible through the ECoinSupply Instant Website and purchase Cryptocurrency using a credit or debit card. 
<br>3.	The fees applicable to each method of Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase are as set out in the Fee Tariff. 
<br>4.	Acceptance by us of an order for a Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase does not guarantee that you will receive the corresponding amount of Cryptocurrency. The Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase is conditional upon actual receipt by us of the funds from your credit or debit card, as well as payment of any applicable fees. 
<br>5.	Subject to clause 7.4 and the transaction being honoured by the Customer’s bank, card provider or other relevant party, Cryptocurrency Instant Purchases shall be credited to any Cryptocurrency wallet maintained and operated either by ECoinSupply (if you also have an Account) or by a third party as soon as possible once the Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase has been confirmed by the Cryptocurrency network. Once submitted to a Cryptocurrency network, a Cryptocurrency Instant Purchase will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Cryptocurrency network. Cryptocurrency transactions that are in a pending state will not be credited to the wallet. 
<br>8.	Cryptocurrency storage 
<br>1.	Once your Account has been opened you will have a digital wallet accessible through the Website where you can store your Cryptocurrency (the "Wallet"). 
<br>2.	ECoinSupply adopts appropriate practices and security measures to protect your Wallet and your information from unauthorized access. For more detail please refer to ECoinSupply Privacy Policy. 
<br>3.	The Customer has the option to create one or more sub-wallets within a Wallet in either US Dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling or a particular Cryptocurrency (each being a "Sub-Wallet"). The Customer can at any time manage the overall funds held in their Wallet by selling the funds they have in a Sub-Wallet to us and requesting that the proceeds are paid in a different currency into a different Sub-Wallet (a "Currency Exchange Transaction"). 
<br>4.	A Currency Exchange Transaction shall be subject to a fee equal to a percentage of the amount of the Currency Exchange Transaction (the "Exchange Fee") which is set out in the Fee Tariff. ECoinSupply shall take payment of the Exchange Fee by deducting the relevant amount from the total of the Currency Exchange Transaction. 
<br>5.	The exchange rate applied to a Currency Exchange Transaction will be provided to you through the Website as part of a Currency Exchange Transaction. 
<br>6.	The Customer shall have no right to withdraw funds held in a Sub-Wallet other than by way of a Cryptocurrency Transfer on the terms set out in clause 9, Cryptocurrency Withdrawal on the terms set out in clause 10, or as otherwise permitted under terms and conditions separate to this Agreement. 
<br>7.	Transfers between the Wallet and a Sub-Wallet, or between Sub-Wallets, shall take place immediately. 
<br>8.	Each Sub-Wallet shall not be subject to any overdraft, advance, credit or discount. 
<br>9.	Cryptocurrency Transfer 
<br>1.	Cryptocurrency (or part thereof) held in the Wallet or in a Sub-Wallet may be transferred to another customer’s Cryptocurrency wallet or an external Cryptocurrency wallet maintained and operated by a third party. ECoinSupply shall specify the information required to effect a Cryptocurrency Transfer at the point of instruction but, as a minimum, ECoinSupply shall require the: 
<br>1.	address of the recipient’s wallet; and 
<br>2.	amount to be transferred. 
<br>2.	We may charge network fees (miner fees) to process a Cryptocurrency Transfer on your behalf. We will calculate the network fee at our discretion, although we will always notify you of the network fee at or before the time you authorise the Cryptocurrency Transfer. Once submitted to a Cryptocurrency network, a Cryptocurrency Transfer will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Cryptocurrency network. Cryptocurrency transactions that are in a pending state will not be transferred to the Wallet until such time as the Cryptocurrency transaction has been confirmed. 
<br>3.	The fees applicable to a Cryptocurrency Transfer are as set out in the Fee Tariff. 
<br>4.	If the Customer instructs a Cryptocurrency Transfer in respect of amounts held in a Sub-Wallet which relates to a currency which is different to the Cryptocurrency to be transferred, a Currency Exchange Transaction will take place prior to transfer (and will thus incur an Exchange Fee). 
<br>5.	ECoinSupply has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party using Cryptocurrency Transfer. We will process Cryptocurrency transaction in accordance with the instructions we receive from you. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. 
<br>10.	Cryptocurrency withdrawals 
<br>1.	Any Cryptocurrency Withdrawals must take place from the Euro Sub-Wallet. 
<br>2.	If the Customer instructs a Cryptocurrency Withdrawal in respect of amounts held other than in the Euro Sub-Wallet, a Currency Exchange Transaction must first take place where such amounts will be converted to Euros and placed in the Euro Sub-Wallet at the exchange rate applicable immediately prior to the Cryptocurrency Withdrawal being made (and will incur an Exchange Fee). 
<br>3.	The Customer shall be entitled to make a Cryptocurrency Withdrawal from the Euro Sub-Wallet to a Linked Account only. For the avoidance of doubt, a Cryptocurrency Withdrawal cannot be made to any account other than a Linked Account. 
<br>4.	Cryptocurrency Withdrawals may be subject to such minimum and (cumulative) maximum daily amounts as ECoinSupply may specify from time to time. Information on any applicable minimum and maximum amounts shall be stated on the Website. 
<br>5.	ECoinSupply will deduct a "Withdrawal Fee" in accordance with the Fee Tariff from all Cryptocurrency Withdrawals. 
<br>6.	Cryptocurrency Withdrawals will, subject to orders to make a Cryptocurrency Withdrawal being received between 09am and 12pm UK time on a Business Day, be processed on the date of request. All other Cryptocurrency Withdrawals will be processed on the next Business Day. 
<br>11.	Incorrect or unauthorised Cryptocurrency transfers or Cryptocurrency withdrawals 
<br>1.	In the event that you become aware of any incorrect or unauthorised Cryptocurrency Withdrawals or Cryptocurrency Transfer, you must notify us this immediately by email to support@eCoinSupply.me. Prior to receiving such notification, we will not be responsible for any loss or damage that you suffer as a result of a Cryptocurrency Withdrawal or Cryptocurrency Transfer which was executed without your consent.

<br>3.	any Cryptocurrency Purchase, ECoinSupply Instant Purchase, Cryptocurrency Withdrawal or Cryptocurrency Transfer is significantly larger in size, or together with other recent Cryptocurrency Purchases, ECoinSupply Instant Purchases, Cryptocurrency Withdrawals or Cryptocurrency Transfers, is significantly larger in volume than expected; 
<br>4.	ECoinSupply reasonably believes that it is necessary or desirable to do so in order to protect the security of the Account, including circumstances where any Account Details may have been lost or stolen; or

<br>6.	ECoinSupply reasonably suspects that you have provided us with false information or fabricated documents. 
<br>2.	In the case of any such withholding or suspension described in this clause 12, ECoinSupply shall make reasonable efforts to inform you about the withholding or suspension, provided that such disclosure: 
<br>1.	is not in breach of any applicable law or regulation and does not contravene the instruction of any competent authority or regulator; and 
<br>2.	would not compromise ECoinSupply's reasonable security measures. 
<br>3.	ECoinSupply shall not be liable to you for any losses you may suffer as a result of any reasonable action it takes to suspend the Account or withhold settlement of a Cryptocurrency Purchase, ECoinSupply Instant Purchase, Cryptocurrency Withdrawal or Cryptocurrency Transfer in accordance with this clause 12.
